# Gradle - Check duplicate classes 

This Gradle plugin checks whether different artifacts in a configuration provide the same classes. Since this leads to rather nasty bugs, you probably want to find these problems beforehand. A typical cause of such issues are artifacts that changed their maven group id but kept there packages like 'c3p0:c3p0' that has been renamed to 'com.mchange:c3p0'.

## Usage

You can either use the new plugin mechanism introduced with Gradle 2.1

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
plugins {
  id 'net.idlestate.gradle-duplicate-classes-check' version '1.0.0'
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

or the 'classic' way

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url 'https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/'
    }
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath 'gradle.plugin.net.idlestate:gradle-duplicate-classes-check:1.0.0'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'net.idlestate.gradle-duplicate-classes-check'
--------------------------------------------------------------------

to apply the plugin to your project.

The check is performed by the task `checkForDuplicateClasses` that has been added as dependency to the task `check`.
